Challenges include the current COVID-19 social and economic crises, but also forward focused initiatives for how we can build a better and stronger future environment, improving education, health, work, and governance etc. The challenge streams are guided by the UN Sustainable Development Goals, however participants will decide for themselves what they want to work on under the guidance of hundreds of remote, expert mentors to help them conceptualise and develop working prototypes to test their ideas.

Participants and supporters have gathered from around the world for the most important hackathon of their lives.
