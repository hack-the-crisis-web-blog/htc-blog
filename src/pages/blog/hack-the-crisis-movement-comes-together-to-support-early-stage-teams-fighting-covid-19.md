  14-15th of May, The Global Hack put on a virtual matchmaking event that
  brought together the whole Hack the Crisis movement to take the hackathons to
  the next level. More than 60 events and thousands of ideas later, many teams
  are actively looking for support to implement their innovations generated
  during the hackathons. The Hack the Crisis Matchathon event connected the
  early-stage teams with world-class experts, investors, and policymakers.

With the **European Commission’s** support of the matchathon, hundreds of teams participated in speed dates on Talque platform during 24 hours. They had a chance to talk with experts such as the **VP of Facebook Konstantinos Papamiltiadis**, **Joseph (JD) D'Cruz from the United Nations Development Programme**, many others and exchanged ideas with each other. and But it wasn’t only for hackers, many of the inspirational leaders from The Global Hack joined to see how their teams were going ahead with ideas.



Innovation and new ideas are crucial in times of crisis. But setting them up can be difficult, and early stage teams need individual support to take their projects to the next level. “We are committed to building this matchathon format further to offer a resource for any early-stage idea who is ready to take next steps,” says **Hack the Crisis Matchathon co-organiser Kai Isand**. “We will keep the platform open to all interested teams offering them the needed know-how through a series of webinars and 1-on-1 coaching with experts, also providing a growing list of organisations, experts, and mentors ready to help the teams,” adds Isand.\

One such partner is the European Commission, which is committed to support all teams that come out from the Hack the Crisis movement. **Helen Köpman, Deputy Head of Unit Blockchain and Digital Innovation at the European Commission**, explains: “If you have solutions that have the potential for the European market are growing an innovative business, you can check out the funding opportunities available on the Startup Europe One-Stop-Shop at [https://startupeuropeclub.eu/ ](https://startupeuropeclub.eu/)and apply to the ones that fit your needs.
