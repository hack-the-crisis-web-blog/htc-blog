In Italy, one of the hardest-hit countries in the novel coronavirus pandemic, the human spirit is very much alive. As videos of people singing from their balconies went viral online, others were sitting on their sofas with laptops coming up with solutions to new and complex problems. Issues like scarcity and processing time of tests, social isolation of at-risk groups, and lack of income for shuttered businesses. The beauty of their solutions is that not only can they xxx now, but they will continue helping people in new ways long after the crisis ends.

The crisis is highlighting vulnerabilities in healthcare systems, digital infrastructure, and social groups. Many skilled and motivated people have decided, however, not to be mere spectators.As part of the worldwide “Hack the Crisis” movement, teams are forming online, in defiance of borders and the virus, to rapidly brainstorm and prototype apps, gadgets, social initiatives and pretty much everything you can dream of to solve challenges posed by the coronavirus crisis.

Following the success of the first Hack the Crisis event in Estonia from March 13-15, over 47 countries have followed suit including Italy, which held its event March 27-29. Fifty-five teams and a total of 15,000 participants dialed in to the entirely online event and paired up with friends and complete strangers to create the solutions their country needs. Over the course of just 48 hours, programmers and marketers, salespeople and good samaritans developed some inspiring ideas.

The four-person team behind Orainsieme, (Italian for “now” and “together”), tackled the issues of social isolation and how to scale telephone help hotlines. Team member Serena Planera, district sales manager at a pharmaceutical company and long-time Red Cross volunteer, has witnessed Italy’s elderly become increasingly socially isolated under quarantine. Without smartphones and computers at home, the elderly are reaching out by their only communications method – the telephone – to coronavirus emergency numbers just to talk to someone.

Recently, the Italian Red Cross alone has been receiving over 300 calls per day and are unable to answer all of them. On the other hand, the organization has over 1,000 unplaced temporary volunteers. Orainsieme is an online platform accessible by phone or internet which allows those in need to connect to a volunteer base.This creates a cross-generational dialogue where young people can provide emotional support and the latest news, and the elderly can share their wisdom, like how to make an awesome lasagna.The team sees their platform connecting some of Italy’s 13 million people 65 and older with younger volunteers long after the crisis to help bridge generational divides.

Another product of Italy’s hackathon is [www.promettoditornare.it](http://www.promettoditornare.it), a website where small businesses can sell gift certificates. Team member Raffaele Negro estimates that 80% of local businesses in Italy lack an online presence, so the platform represents a critical way for patrons to buy credit to redeem in the future, generating much-needed income for impacted businesses. In the week following the hackathon, the website had 18,000 unique visitors and 200 requests from businesses to be added to the directory, showing an obvious appetite for the idea.

Less than two weeks out from the event, the hackathon winners are quickly finding ways to bring their ideas to life. They are in need of designers, developers, specialists, marketers, funds and many other assets, but they are not letting that stop them. When so much is uncertain, it is reassuring to see people looking out for their neighbors, their communities, and people far away they may never meet.

Though many national hackathons have passed, if you have an idea or the motivation to make an impact, register now for [The Global Hack](https://theglobalhack.com/), 9-12 April. Make history and partake in the biggest hackathon ever held.
